# A student budgeting web application developed using React, Bootstrap and Firebase.
## About UniClarity
NOTE: Application state handling could be much improved 

UniClarity was developed from identifying a lack of guided support for student budgeting. There are some great solutions for tracking what you have been spending, but you need to figure out what you should be spending first. Going through university, the only good way of calculating a budget was to set up an excel sheet, requiring technical knowledge of excel and the expenses you need to take into account.

The final outcome helps you to find an amount that you can spend every week on whatever you please. This could be a night out, a trip to the cinema or a meal at a restaurant. You decide on this amount by settling at a value that results in an end bank balance you are happy with. In turn, removing the guilt and mystery that surrounds student spending.

## Improvements
* Integrate Redux for a central store of application data and to improve performance on re-renders
